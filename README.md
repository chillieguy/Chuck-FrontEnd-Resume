Chuck-FrontEnd-Resume
=====================

**Project 2** of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree offered by Udacity.

Direct link to gh-pages for [Chuck Resume](http://chillieguy.github.io/Chuck-FrontEnd-Resume/)

This was a project that required me to use helper code to create a resume using only javascript and json.  This project started out frustrating as I tried to get the code to display what I wanted, but became much easier as I figured out how to use helper.js.

**TO DO**  
*Add custom styling/CSS  
*Add additional work experience  
*Add links to social networks
